        <p class="text-align">Hi, my name is Agnes Pinter and welcome to my site. I got my special needs educator and therapist - specialized for physical disabilities- degree in Hungary two years ago. As a mother of two little boys. I’ve just had
          the chance
          to work in my dream
          job.
          While I was a
          student at
          uni I had
          lots of experiences, practices with special needs people (children, young people and adults) at every areas of education and therapies. E.g.: at special needs: primary schools,nursery schools, vocational schools, residents and children’s
          homes, education, individual development, habilitation, rehabilitation,etc.

          I also did exercise therapy for a physically disabled child (from age 1 to 2,5) for about 1,5 years who got very serious CP (cerebral palsy) . It was an incredible and successful experience for me. I would love to work with disabled
          children who desperately need help in the first years of their life.</p>
        <p class="dark text-align">The most important years of developing for special needs children are the first 3 years! We can’t miss these years which have the biggest impact of their life and it’s
          quality! I want to pass on my knowledge and help these children and their families.

          I used to study as a physiotherapist for a year in Hungary as well. I studied there massage and then therapeutic massage for 6 months. I got a Swedish massage certificate in England few years ago. I used to have some private massage
          clients in Hungary and some in England too.

          I’ve completed a few beauty therapist courses this year. At the moment I am qualified to perform any waxing treatments, eyebrows treatments and massages.

          Now I offer my services as a mobile therapist too.</p>
